            "what_is_arima": "ARIMA combines three components: AutoRegressive (AR) - uses past values to predict future, Integrated (I) - differences the data to remove trends, and Moving Average (MA) - uses past forecast errors. It's like a sophisticated pattern recognition system that learns from historical behavior.",
            "why_it_matters": "ARIMA is fundamental for time series forecasting because it captures the underlying patterns in data - trends, seasonality, and dependencies. It's widely used in economics, finance, and operations for planning and decision-making.",
            "model_assumptions": "ARIMA assumes that historical patterns will continue into the future, that the relationship between variables is linear, and that the residuals are normally distributed with constant variance. It works best when the underlying process is relatively stable.",
            "limitations": "ARIMA may struggle with structural breaks, non-linear relationships, or unprecedented events. It assumes past patterns continue and may not adapt quickly to regime changes. External factors not captured in the time series can affect forecast accuracy.",
            "interpretation_guide": "AR(1): The model uses the last 1 values to make predictions - like saying 'tomorrow will be similar to recent days'. I(1): The data was differenced 1 time(s) to remove trends - like focusing on changes rather than levels. MA(1): The model corrects for the last 1 forecast errors - like learning from recent mistakes."

    "interpretation": "The Vector Autoregression (VAR) model has been successfully fitted with 1 lag(s) using AIC criterion for optimal lag selection. This multivariate model captures the dynamic relationships between 3 time series (MSFT, AAPL, NEM.US), with a total of 12 parameters estimated. The single lag structure suggests that each variable's current value depends primarily on its own and other variables' values from the previous period, indicating relatively short-term interdependencies in the system. Granger causality analysis of 3 directional relationships reveals: No significant predictive relationships were found, suggesting that past values of these variables do not help predict each other beyond what each variable's own history provides."

These variable pairs move very similarly, indicating strong co-movement patterns. **Moderate Correlations (0.3-0.7)**: MSFT-AAPL (0.426), MSFT-NEM.US (0.537).
