Unlike traditional models that assume constant volatility, GARCH recognizes that volatility clusters - periods of high volatility are followed by high volatility, and calm periods by calm periods. It's like a volatility thermostat that adjusts based on recent market stress.",
            "why_it_matters": "Volatility forecasting is crucial for risk management, option pricing, and portfolio optimization. GARCH helps quantify how risk evolves over time, enabling better decision-making about position sizing, hedging strategies, and capital allocation. It's widely used in finance because it captures the reality that market risk is not constant.",
            "volatility_clustering": "The famous quote 'large changes tend to be followed by large changes, of either sign, and small changes tend to be followed by small changes' captures the essence of volatility clustering. During market stress (like COVID-19), daily stock movements of 5-10% become common, but during calm periods, daily movements of 0.5-1% are typical.",
            "model_components": "Omega (\u03c9 = 4.562000): The baseline volatility level - think of it as the 'volatility floor'. Alpha (\u03b1 = 1.000): How sensitive volatility is to recent shocks - the 'shock amplifier'. Beta (\u03b2 = 0.993): How much past volatility influences current volatility - the 'memory factor'. The model says: Today's volatility = baseline + recent shock impact + yesterday's volatility influence.",
            "persistence_implications": "Persistence (\u03b1 + \u03b2 = 1.993) measures how long volatility shocks last. High persistence means volatility shocks have long-lasting effects - like ripples in a pond that take time to settle. Low persistence means volatility quickly returns to normal levels after shocks. Values near 1.0 indicate very persistent volatility, while values near 0.5 indicate quick mean reversion.",
            "limitations": "GARCH assumes volatility clustering follows specific patterns and may not capture: (1) Structural breaks or regime changes, (2) Asymmetric volatility (leverage effects), (3) Extreme market events outside historical patterns, (4) Non-linear volatility dynamics. It works best in relatively stable market regimes with consistent volatility patterns."
